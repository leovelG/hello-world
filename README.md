# hello-world
Here's a brief description of myself:  
## Introduction of me :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm **Leonel Gerardo Velázquez García** a young enthusiast engineer who wants to improve some coding skills and luckily make some friends meanwhile. 
## A brief background :
I've studied geophysical engineering, why, because I wanted to know how the world works, I did find some keys but I'm still far from my goal. Finishing my studies I've started working on the electrical industry, I've learnt about electrical devices like relays, transformers, inductors etc... This help me a lot to undertsand how our technology works, from an electrical switch to the transistors that were the foundations of nowadays technology.
